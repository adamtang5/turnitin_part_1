# Remove Duplicates

In this folder, the `removeDuplicates` function can be found in
`03-remove-duplicates.js`.

## Set up for test

`npm install` to install dependencies for `mocha` test. Then run `npm test` to
make sure that the function passes the tests. I've written test specs in
`test/03-remove-duplicates-spec.js`.
